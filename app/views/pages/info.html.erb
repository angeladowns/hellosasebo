    <h1>A Sasebo Code Club Project</h1>
    <h6>We're learning to program. Come learn with us!</h6>
  </div>

  <div class="w3-container">
    <p>The Sasebo Code Club is a group of aspiring web developers who get together every week to learn to program. We meet at the USO in Nimitz Park on Wednesday mornings from 9:30 am to 11:30 am. The USO is quiet, comfortable, and child-friendly. If you're interested in learning how to code, come learn with us!</p>
    <p>The purpose of the app is to compile a directory of places to eat, shop, and explore around Sasebo. This project, with community input, will help make it a tiny bit easier for new arrivals to explore Sasebo. I hope you find it useful.</p>
