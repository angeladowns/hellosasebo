# Hello, Sasebo!
January 2017

Ruby version 2.3.1 // Rails version 5.0.0.1

This adventure app was created using the Rails Girls LA Guide located at: https://gist.github.com/jendiamond/5a26b531e8e47b4aa638.

## A Sasebo Code Club Project
The Sasebo Code Club is a group of aspiring web developers who get together every week to learn to program. We meet at the USO in Nimitz Park on Wednesday mornings from 9:30 am to 11:30 am. The USO is quiet, comfortable, and child-friendly. If you're interested in learning how to code, come learn with us!

The purpose of the app is to compile a directory of places to eat, shop, and explore around Sasebo. This project, with community input, will help make it a tiny bit easier for new arrivals to explore Sasebo. I hope you find it useful.
